Perform the MEG Experiment (Participant is present)
---------------------------------------------------

#. If the participant is a veil-wearing female:
    - sign on door
    - block door with the isolation found behind the laser scan room door

#. Welcoming the participant and providing them with explanations
    - [WELCOME] Thank you for joining our study. Is this your first time in the MEG?
    - [GENERAL OVERVIEW] No worry, Let me explain to you now what we are going to do today.
    - [BEFORE MEG - HEAD SHAPE] Before you are going into the MEG, we need to do some preparation.
    - Explain the FastScan head laser scan:
        - I will scan your head shape with a laser gun [show the FastScan]
        - This is giving us a 3D reconstruction of the shape of your head
        - To do that, you need to sit there and not move for around 5-7 minutes
        - Moreover, I have to mark five points on your forehead and close to your ears with this [show it] washable ink,
        - it will disappear after just one shower [show the phantom head with the points]
        - Why are we doing that? To know where your head is located while you are in the MEG.
        - This is important for the study we are running because we need to know where the data recorded by the MEG sensors
        - that measure the tiny changes in the magnetic field generated by the brain activity, is coming from.
        - You know, different people have different head shape/size,...
        - and they place the head in slightly different sites relative to the MEG sensors.
        - Why the points? When we are in the MEG room
        - I will tape you small things called ‘head position coils’ in the places you have these painted points
        - and this will tell us where your head is relative to the MEG sensors
        - It looks a bit weird at the beginning, but you get used to it soon(I did the experiment on myself)
        - [BEFORE MEG - CLOTHES]
            - Another important thing is that you cannot go inside of the MEG room with any kind of metallic object
            - because it will create an artifact on the MEG sensors.
            - To ensure that, I have to ask you to wear this MEG compatible clothes (like the ones in the hospitals).
            - Please, if you feel comfortable with that, you should take off your bra (most of the time there are small metallic trips or parts).
        - [INSIDE MEG]
            - Explain the study-specific instructions here or give them an instruction manual to read.\
            - Now, let me recap what we will do today. You need to fill the forms, scan your brain shape,
            - then you need to change clothes. You go to the MEG room, we tape coils in your  forehead. And then, you will do the tasks.
        - [END OF EXPLANATION] Is everything clear? Do you have any questions? Do you feel comfortable? Are you ok? Please let me know, this is important for us that you understand everything.

#. Fill up forms
    - Ensure that we have the electronically signed two consents. If not, make the participant sign by hand [LINK]
    - Fill up contact, demographic, and handness forms [LINK]

#. Check up MEG incompatibilities
    - Make participant change their clothes by hospital clothing (scrubs), keeping underwear and socks (not bra)
    - Make sure they have NO metallic objects in the body/eyes
        - Surgery? Surgical clip, artificial heart valve, implanted drug pump
        - Bullet
        - Cochlear implant or hearing aid
        - Make-up, especially red color makeup
        - Hair pins
        - Jewelry and piercings
        - Keys
        - Phone
    - If the subject arrives with make-up, ask him/her to completely remove it
    - If the subject wears glasses, ask them to remove the glasses and provide them with an MR compatible glasses from the briefcase found in the lab
        - Determine their vision prescription and provide them with the closest matching pair of glasses from the briefcase.

#. Perform the FastScan laser head scan
    - Capping the participant
        - Put the 'pink' swimming cap on the head of the person
        - Make sure the cap is as smooth as possible on the participant's head
        - People with long hair, can keep most part of their hair outside the cap behind their ears and onto the back
        - The ears must be clear of hair
        - The cap must cover all the hair that can be seen at the anterior, left and right parts of the head
        - Smoothen the hair under the cap as much as possible, excess long hair can be drawn to outside the cap at the cerebellum level
        - The goal is that the cap takes the shape of the skull at best
    - Mark the fiducials
        - Use the “T” template, with the line aligning the participant’s nasion as in the below picture

        .. figure:: figures/meg-operationprotocol/template_nasion.png
            :alt: Template and Nasion
            :align: center

            "T" template on the right and nasion/pre(auricular) positions on the left.

        - Mark the nasion using a pen (fiducial 1)
        - Adjust the "T" template to the participants nasion
        - Using a pen marker, mark fiducials 6, 7 and 8 by using the three holes in the "T" template

        .. figure:: figures/meg-operationprotocol/fiducials.png
            :alt: Fiducials
            :align: center

            Fiducials numbered by the order they should be laser scanned with.

        - Mark the left and right pre-auriculars (1cm anterior to the tragi) and the right and left auriculars
        - Put on the neck brace
            - Place a tissue over the area closest to the mouth on the neck brace for sanitary purposes - see picture

        .. figure:: figures/meg-operationprotocol/neckbrace.png
            :alt: Neck brace with tissue for sanitary purposes
            :align: center

            Neck brace with tissue for sanitary purposes.

    - Perform laser scan
        - Once FastScan is finished initializing (indicated at the bottom of the software UI):
            - Ask the participant to close their eyes and avoid any movements until scan is finished
            - Open `FastScan II` software on the computer
            - Press 'New'
            - Ensure the scanner is in Sweep mode (add [IMAGE])
            - Point the laser gun at the `laser scanner reference point` (the box on the ring you place around the neck, see below) with a half-click, followed by a full click.

            .. figure:: figures/meg-operationprotocol/reference_point.png

            - Scan head shape (sweeps) with full click. Tips:
                - All cap surface + surfaces with fiducial points
                - Avoid overlapping sweeps
                - Making sweeps for head and face separately.
                - Keep a consistent distance between the head and scanner.

                .. hint::

                    Press half a click while using the laser scanner to shift the view on the `FastScan II` software to the current view as seen from the device.
                    This feature allows you to quickly identify areas that are not covered well by the current laser scan.

        - After sweeps, switch to Laser Points and click on Stylus List for points options, ensure that Stylus > Properties > Capture Points (NOT capture lines)
            - Close the flap down on the laser gun and start registering the fiducial points following this order - see picture.
            - Nasion - between eye-brows (not marked)
            - (Participant's) left tragus - cartilage of left ear (not marked)
            - Right tragus - cartilage of right ear (not marked)
            - Left marker - marked left ear
            - Right marker - marked right ear
            - Center forehead - marked center forehead point
            - Left forehead - marked left forehead point
            - Right forehead - marked right forehead point
        - Ensure that you have only 8 points selected on the Stylus List
        - Tell participant they can move back again
    - Return the scanner and box to the foam holder on the table, and make sure none of the cords are on the floor
        `THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE DEVICE` - see picture

    .. figure:: figures/meg-operationprotocol/fast_scan_pack.png
        :alt: Fast Scanner Box
        :align: center

        FastScan divide MUST be always like this: laser on foam, cables on table (not floor).

    - Remove the cap from the participant's head and toss into the washing bin
    - Put off the neck brace and make participant stand up
    - Save as (this is the .fsn files)
    - Create folder: FastScan Files/<Lab_Name>/<Study CODE>/sub_<subjectID>/ sess_<session_number>
    - [e.g. sub_12/sess_01]
    - Filename: `sub-<subjectID>-sess-<session_number>_<data in yyyymmdd>_raw.fsn`
    - Export as basic surface   (check)
    - Save the file as `sub-<subjectID>_basicsurface.txt`

#. Participant goes into the MSR
    - Subject wears off the shoes
    - Subject sits on the bed (looking at the small table)
    - Place the five Head Position Indicator (HPI) coils on the marker points - see picture below [IMAGE]
        - Each HPI coil is marked by a color that correspond to the position of placement of the coil on the head
        - The position of the HPI coil on the participant's head should follow the following mapping
        - Bring the forehead markers over the top of the head so the wires are not in the participant’s face
        - Do not loop the ear markers behind the ears
    - Place earphones [IMAGE]
    - Assist the participant with the wires while they move into the helmet [IMAGE]
    - Place the bubble wrap burritos on the sides of the participant’s head as shown in the photo. This will help to keep their head still as well as keeping the ear marker coils against the head if the tape fails. You may also want to put tissues around the foam for sanitary purposes.
    - Place the pillow on the legs for the back rest
    - [Optional] if the experiment requires it, place the `Vpixx Response Box` or the `Dial` to their right/or left hand (depending on their convenience)
        - Tape the box to the mattress, to avoid making the box fall from the mattress
    - Tape any loose wires for the markers and the button boxes
    - **Ensure  that the participant is comfortable**
    - Close and lock the MSR door

            Continuous mode (left) and Marker measurement (right).

        - A `.mrk` file named as `YYYYMMDD-x.mrk` is automatically generated in the specified directory following the marker measurement, where `x` is an integer 1,2,3,... indicating the order of recording of the marker
        - If your experiment is lengthy i.e. 2 hours long, we recommend that you perform a marker measurement in between, i.e., after 1 hour is elapsed
    - On “Monitor and Acquisition” window:
        - Continuous Mode > Start - see above picture
        - Sampling rate: 1000 (default)
        - Time: 4000 [66 minutes] (this is the maximum possible time in the MEG160 software)
        - Start Acquisition
        - You can now safely start your experiment from the `Stimulus computer`
    - If your experiment is lengthy i.e. 2 hours long, we recommend that you perform a marker measurement in between, i.e., after 1 hour is elapsed
    - [While end-of-task text is prompted] Perform marker measurement again as in the step above
    - Main task - block 1 (see points 8-10)
        - Start recording
        - Talk with subject
        - Switch ON USB dial
        - Start task
    - [While end-of-task text is prompted] Marker measurement (see point 7)
    - Main task - block 2 (see points 8-10)
        - Start recording
        - Talk with subject
        - Start task
    - [While end-of-task text is prompted] Marker measurement (see point 7)
    - Main task - block 3 (see points 8-10)
        - Start recording
        - Talk with subject
        - Start task
    - [While end-of-task text is prompted] Perform another Marker measurement (see point 7)
    - Finish up MEG session (see point 11)
        - Talk with subject
#. Stop continuous recording (when task finishes, or if the experiment spans for more than 4000 seconds and needs a new recording)
    - On “Monitor and Acquisition” window - see picture 14:
        - Continuous Mode > Abort
#. Finish up the MEG session (when all tasks are done!)
    - On “Monitor and Acquisition” window:
        - ‘Unlock’ [VERY IMPORTANT STEP, DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE IT]
        - Close MEG160 software
#. Take out participant from MSR
    - [ONLY WHEN SENSORS ARE UNLOCK!] Open the MSR door
    - When removing the head-position indicator coils and earphones, do the removal yourself. The coils in particular are very fragile and expensive. Remove with care.
    - Ask participant to change clothes back and put the scrubs in the wash bin (in the laser scan room)
    - Pay the participant and make her sign the receipt.


After the MEG session
---------------------

#. Settings MEG
   - Do not shut down any of the computers. They can all be locked or logged off.
   - Turn on the heater cable [THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT] - see picture above
   - Switch off the dial through the USB board.
   - Turn off the MSR lights.
   - Double-check that you turned the heater cable back on.
#. Clean room
   - Clean the helmet, head-position indicator coils, and button box with alcohol wipes.
   - Wipe down the FastScan neck brace and any other surfaces the participant came in contact with
#. Postprocessing
    - Apply Noise Reduction filter using the reference magnetometers
        - The KIT system is equipped with reference magnetometers on channels 208 till 223, that measures the external magnetic field
        - [Optional] you can noise reduce your SQUID data (channel 0-207) by applying a filter that uses the data from channels 208 to 223
            - Open the produced `.con` file in the default app `MEG160` then apply a Noise Reduction filter using Edit -> Noise Reduction
            - Make sure the Magnetometers on channels 208, 209, 210 are used.
            - Execute the noise reduction, then File -> Save As -> add `_NR` at the end of the file name.
            - Transfer both files to NYU BOX as detailed in the data uploading section.
    - FastScan Instructions
        - Open FastScanII software (icon on desktop)
        - Open <projectname>_sub<subjectID>_sess<session_number>_<date in ddmmyyyy>_raw.fsn file previously generated (Desktop > FastScan Files)
        - Click on ‘Select’ and start dragging your mouse over areas you want to delete
        - To delete points you’ve selected, simply click on the backspace key on your keyboard
        - Then go to Edit > Generate Surface
            - Smoothing = 5mm
            - Decimation = 3mm
    - In the pop-up, click on Apply Basic Surface, then close it
    - To save your head scan, go to File > Save As > [attention to path] FastScan Files/sreenivasan_lab/sub_<subjectID>/ sess_<session_number>/<projectname>_sub<subjectID>_sess<session_number>_<date in ddmmyyyy>.fsn
    - Edit > Generate surface > Apply basic surface
        - Basic surface has fewer than 10,000 points
        - If not, decimate: Generate > Surface Simplification = 0.10 > Apply (Basic Surface)
    - File > Export > save as
        - sweeps by appending ‘_basic’ to the filename: <projectname>_sub<subjectID>_sess<session_number>_<date in ddmmyyyy>_basic
        - points by appending  ‘_points’ to the filename: <projectname>_sub<subjectID>_sess<session_number>_<date in ddmmyyyy>_points
#. Uploading to NYU BOX
    - You should have your own folder on `NYU BOX` named after your project
    - Refer to the uploading data section to upload your data


Perspectives for KIT Operational Protocol
-----------------------------------------

- Automate the `Noise Reduction` filter for multi-subjects in `MEG160`
- Automatic savings of the `.con` files was enabled before but is no longer the case, it would be ideal to go back to automatic saving

Appendix. B: Marker coils for KIT order of appearence in .mrk
-------------------------------------------------------------

The registered `.mrk` file containing the position of the HPI coils for KIT.
Using `fieldtrip` function named `ft_read_headshape('PATH TO .mrk')`, we report the order of appearence
of the HPI coils positions in the `.mrk` file below.
This has been tested with many `.mrk` files in the current pluggin setting (last column)

+----------------------+-----------------------------+-------+---------------------+
| Order of appearance  | Placing position of HPI     | Color | Plugging order      |
| in the .mrk          | Coil on head                |       | in Marker Box       |
+======================+=============================+=======+=====================+
| 1                    | Central Forehead (CF)       | Blue  | 2                   |
